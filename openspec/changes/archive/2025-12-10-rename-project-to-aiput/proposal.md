# Change: Rename Project to AIPut

## Why
The new name "AIPut" better reflects the project's core functionality of using AI-powered voice input to put text into computer applications. It's shorter, more memorable, and avoids potential branding conflicts with the QAA-Tools organization.

## What Changes
- Rename project from "QAA AirType" to "AIPut" in all configuration files
- Update package name from "qaa-airtype" to "aiput"
- Change window titles and tray icon text to reflect new name
- Update documentation (README, project docs) with new project name
- Update repository URLs to https://github.com/newbe36524/AIPut
- Update any user-facing text and comments to use new name

## Impact
- Affected specs: project-renaming (new spec to be created)
- Affected code: pyproject.toml, source files with window titles, documentation, README
